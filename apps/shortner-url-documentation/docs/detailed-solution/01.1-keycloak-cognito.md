# Keycloak or Cognito

### The kind of users
The user who needs authentication was not the largest number of users
for our solution.


### Solution POV:
Although cognito has its advantages, mainly from a corporate point of view, 
Keycloak gives us more control over any customization (although it is not advisable). 
But it makes us independent of the cloud we choose.

### API functionallity:
Keycloak provide a large number of API's to control Identity Management.

We can see in:

### Customizing Keycloak:
Keycloak using Java to customize. I do not suggest customizing deeply keycloak.
If we do that, we will have problems to update the product
