# Why Elastic Search?

### What is the role of Elastic Search in our Solution
Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of 
addressing a growing number of use cases. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, 
it centrally stores your data for lightning fast search, fineâ€‘tuned relevancy, 
and powerful analytics that scale with ease.

We will store in an asynchronous way all visitors' data in Elastic Search.
